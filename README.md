# polyglot-test-quarkus
Quarkus does not work with GraalVM polyglot feature since release 1.2.1

This is simpliest possible test application to run JavaScript inside of Quarkus application.
It werks perfect with release 1.2.1 but does not work with any new up to 1.4.1

GraalVM 20.0.0 CE is needed to run this test application
